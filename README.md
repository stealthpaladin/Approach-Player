Approach-Player
===============

An HTML5 and Flash web player with a small, clean and extensible architecture. Licensed in Apache v2.


I am really really busy at the moment and this package is not 100% complete. It works great and most features
have been tested but a few small glitches remain from recent removals.

Player needs about 1-2 weeks of work from a good JS developer and a good graphic artist.  
If you are really going to work on it and need help on the little bit of left over action script let me know and I'll help out.

Things you can do:

- Show HTML content over or in your video
- Change anything you can select with jQuery at a specific time in the video according to AJAX services.
- "Range Change", Same thing, but having a start/stop time and event layers. For the brave.
- VAST Linear Video ads are easy, but the vast plugin is not even finished at all. It's more a demo of how you dont need an ad library, but maybe a class and a handler - which it will turn into when I'm done working on major release projects.
- Tracking events, social things, etc
- Cue Points have built in features for: Overlays, Projector, Companion, In-stream Video, Interactive Site Component
- Style everything with only CSS, add new buttons easily

Another great thing about this player - it's incredibly easy to learn, extend and get working!
Though I do need to fix up the reflection and properly add it to a jQuery plugin or something plus the above issues.

It's really quite close to finished. Programmer Joseph Aames, myself and a few community developers that were just passing through released this under same license a few months back off-site and haven't had time to finish it just yet.
